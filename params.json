Is no way to overstride on it. The user cannot perform the exercise if lands other way than mid-front of the foot.\r\n* Detects eventual unbalances, highly accurate.\r\n* Collects biomechanics data and uploads it to servers and apps.\r\n\r\n### The components and their role\r\n\r\n* The running pad\r\n![Calybro running pad](http://i.imgur.com/8Aa0LMu.png)\r\nThe running pad is made of athletics tracks material, 50x50 cm and 2 cm thick.\r\nThere are two horizontal bands and two vertical bands. These are [velostat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1361) sensors. When touched, these sensors will transmit certain information to the electronic device.  \r\n2 distance sensors are placed at the end of the velostat bands.\r\n\r\n* The electronic component\r\n![Calybro - electronic part](blob:http%3A//imgur.com/e34582cf-52b9-4270-a380-f2a454abaf9b)\r\nThe electronic component has a display showing various information about the activity. An Arduino board is linked to the velostat bands from the running pad. The Arduino board has a bluetooth module, which will communicate with a mobile application. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How to use the fitness device\r\n## Starting/stopping an activity\r\n* Start the mobile application to connect with the device\r\n* Press \"Start\" on the device's button\r\n* Start the activity\r\n* Press \"Stop\" on the mobile application when done, or press \"Finish\" on the fitness device\r\n## Using the running pad\r\nThe running pad has a transparent slippery surface. The athletes would wear socks only, to facilitate the sliding motion.\r\n## The fitness activities\r\nStart sliding beginning from the upper velostat band, toward the lower velostat band, trying to touch the bands intersections.\r\n## Display information\r\nWhen touching the upper bands intersections, the landing sign, denoted with a target mark, will flash green and the accuracy will be updated.  \r\nWhen releasing the foot from the ground, the take off sign, denoted with a bow, will flash green and its accuracy will be updated.  \r\nThe distance ran will be calculated with the help of the distance sensors times steps made.\r\n\r\n### The heatmap of muscles involved in the activity\r\n![Calybro - muscles affected](http://i.imgur.com/cWrnCKq.png)\r\nThe main activity which can be done is by all means a strength exercise. The effects on aerobic capacity is too low to be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
