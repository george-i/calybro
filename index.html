<ul>
<li>It can be primarily used for legs and abdomen strength exercises.</li>
<li>Improves running form. Is no way to overstride on it. The user cannot perform the exercise if lands other way than mid-front of the foot.</li>
<li>Detects eventual unbalances, highly accurate.</li>
<li>Collects biomechanics data and uploads it to servers and apps.</li>
</ul>

<a id="the-running-pad" class="anchor" href="#the-running-pad" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The running pad</h3>

<p>The running pad is made of athletics tracks material, 50x50 cm and 2 cm thick.
There are two horizontal bands and two vertical bands. These are <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1361">velostat</a> sensors. When touched, these sensors will transmit certain information to the electronic device.<br>
2 distance sensors are placed at the end of the velostat bands.

<a id="the-electronic-component" class="anchor" href="#the-electronic-component" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The electronic component</h3>

<p>The electronic component has a display showing various information about the activity. An Arduino board is linked to the velostat bands from the running pad. The Arduino board has a bluetooth module, which will communicate with a mobile application.

<h3>
<a id="startingstopping-an-activity" class="anchor" href="#startingstopping-an-activity" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting/stopping an activity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start the mobile application to connect with the device</li>
<li>Press "Start" on the device's button</li>
<li>Start the activity</li>
<li>Press "Stop" on the mobile application when done, or press "Finish" on the fitness device
### Using the running pad
The running pad has a transparent slippery surface. The athletes would wear socks only, to facilitate the sliding motion.
### The fitness activities
Start sliding beginning from the upper velostat band, toward the lower velostat band, trying to touch the bands intersections.
## Display information
When touching the upper bands intersections, the landing sign, denoted with a target mark, will flash green and the accuracy will be updated.<br>
When releasing the foot from the ground, the take off sign, denoted with a bow, will flash green and its accuracy will be updated.<br>
The distance ran will be calculated with the help of the distance sensors times steps made.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main activity which can be done is by all means a strength exercise. The effects on aerobic capacity is too low to be used for this purpose.
